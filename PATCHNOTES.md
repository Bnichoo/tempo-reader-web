- Reader
  - Smooth follow with manual scroll override (no periodic “3-line hop”)
  - Selection pauses playback; click-to-toggle play/pause
  - Focus/dim scale + blur; first-letter tint; sentence aid
  - Context menu: Go to text / Select sentence / Clear sentence / Add clip
  - Clicking text now pauses only when playing (no jump); clicking while paused still jumps to clicked word.
- Controls
  - Drawer with sliders: tempo, words shown, spacing, text size, scales, blur
  - Import/Export settings; auto-backup on close
  - Dark mode polish
- Clips
  - Create clips from selection or single word, jump to text
- Safety/performance
  - Paste as plain text (sanitized)
  - Virtualized rendering for long texts
- Known items
  - Clip management (edit range, reorder/pin, search) pending
  - Note editor undo/redo pending
