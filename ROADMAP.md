# Tempo Reader ‚Äì Roadmap

## ‚úÖ Current capabilities
- Reader
  - Tokenized display with virtualization
  - Smooth ‚Äúsoft follow‚Äù of focus; manual scroll override
  - Focus/out-of-focus scaling + blur sliders
  - First-letter tint; sentence-aid highlight (double click)
  - Right-click bubble menu (Go to text / Select sentence / Clear sentence / Add clip)
  - Click-to-toggle play/pause (dispatches `tempo:toggle`)
  - Selection pauses playback (dispatches `tempo:pause`)
- Controls
  - Drawer with sliders: tempo, words shown, spacing, text size, focus/dim scale, blur
  - Import/Export settings; auto-backup on unload
  - Dark mode
- Clips
  - Create from selection or word; shows snippet + note (basic editor)
  - Jump to text from clip
- Safety/perf
  - Paste-as-plain-text (sanitized)
