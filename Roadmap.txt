ðŸ”´ Phase 1: Stability & Robustness (Week 1-2)
Critical Fixes

 Resizer UX - Make divider grabbable with visible affordance (8px hit area, cursor change)
 Error boundaries - Wrap Reader, Clips, and Modal in error boundaries with recovery UI
 Data validation - Schema validation for imports, sanitize all user inputs
 Confirmation dialogs - Add for delete clip, clear all clips, destructive imports

Keyboard Navigation

 Escape key - Close all modals, menus, drawers consistently
 Arrow keys - Navigate clips list when focused
 Tab navigation - Proper tab order through controls
 Shortcuts panel - Discoverable list of all keyboard commands

Visual Affordances

 Scroll indicators - Arrow hints or gradient fades on dock overflow
 Loading states - Spinners for file processing, import/export
 Toast notifications - Non-blocking feedback for actions (clip saved, settings exported)
 Empty states - Better messaging when no clips, no text loaded


ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2: Performance & Scale (Week 3-4)
Storage Migration

 IndexedDB adapter - Move clips to IndexedDB (keep settings in localStorage)
 Storage monitor - Show usage, warn before limits
 Chunked operations - Batch large imports/exports
 Migration utility - Auto-migrate existing localStorage data

Performance Optimization

 Debouncing - Search (300ms), backup (5s), resize (100ms)
 Virtual scroll - Clips list when >50 items
 Web Worker tokenization - Non-blocking for texts >10k words
 Memoization - Cache expensive calculations (filteredClips, wordIdxData)

Reader Improvements

 Font size boundaries - Adjust follow behavior for 16px vs 28px fonts
 Smooth resume - Remember position between sessions
 Progress indicator - Visual progress bar through text
 Jump navigation - Go to percentage/word number


ðŸŸ¢ Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Week 5-6)
